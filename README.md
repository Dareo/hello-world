# hello-world

Hello,
  Im michael harrold, but like to be called dareo koski or zero percent. Im new to this repository and or gethub as 
  you call it. Im sorry if I apear abit nubish. Im a decent python programmer. I praticed programming in python for 
  three to four years, and I still dont know everthing; im no expert haha. but over it was fun doing tutorials 
  trying to learn and develop my skills , but after a while. you feel as if your going in the wrong 
  direction. you feel your level of skill dont cut it tutorials dont work as effectly. programming is nonthing if you 
  cant apply it to a work inviroment. and there isnt many places that can help in thoes areas. I need to be the best
  I possibly can, solving problems logicly is all I know. I just need to develop my skills in making that avalable. 
  make a readible easy to learn repository that anyone can understand and use. because at the end of the day its not
  about how many lines you can code or complexity of your algroithms. its about comunitcation, working togeather to solve
  a problem. and I wish to be apart of that. despide my flaws I wish to be a good asset to a team.
  I want to develop my skills and become the programmer I always 
  dream to be. to finally make a break, and create something I can be proud of.. anyways thanks for 
  listening to my rant. hope you have a good day.
  
  sencerly, zeropercent
